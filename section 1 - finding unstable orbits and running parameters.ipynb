    "Section 1.0: finding and removing all unstable systems\n",

    "Unstable systems will result in significantly increased transit timing variations, which could skew the averaged data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The critical a value (semi-major axis) for \"venus\" was determined to the value when the aphelion of \"venus\"'s orbit woukd cross with the perihelion of \"earth\"'s orbit for each value of 'e' (eccentricity). Equation shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "a_venus(1 + e_venus) = a_earth(1 - e_earth) --> a_venus = 1(1 - 0.05)/1 + e_venus\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This ruled out a number of cases. However. there were still many unstable orbits on the boundary of that line (imagine a 2-dimensional graph with 'e' represented on the x axis and 'a' on the y axis', with the line represented at a=0.95/1+e). \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this we ran trial cases (running the orbit systems for 100,000 years with the minimum exit distance set as 0.05 AU) for e = 0.05, e=0.1, e=0.15 and e=0.2. All cases for 'a' were run starting with a = 0.85 and running until there were 7-16 stable cases in a row. 'f' (anomaly) and 'omega' (location of particle) were randomized for each case between 0.0 and 2pi, which is why many stable orbits had to be seen in a row. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest percent of the critical a value which was a boundary for stable vs unstable cases was found to be ~0.94 (in other words, all cases lower than 0.94 x 'a crit' for each 'e' value were stable). The cutoff for cases was set to 0.93 x 'a crit'. \n",
    "\n",
    "All cases that remained with transit variation (in hours) greater than 9 hours were retested (running the orbit system for 100,000 years, minimum exit distance also 0.05 AU) and all were shown to be stable without exception."
